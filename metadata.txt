about=When projecting data to the orthographic projection, features that cross
    the horizon can lead to unsightly artefacts. By clipping the data to the
    hemisphere that will be visible in the orthographic projection, these
    artifacts can be avoided. This plugin for the QGIS Processing framework
    takes a vector layer and a latitude and longitude for the center of the
    hemisphere and clips the vector layer accordingly. The plugin takes care of
    special cases such as a hemisphere centered on the equator or on one of the
    poles.
changelog=0.2 - Fixed issue with linear features at 180Â° W/E, made plugin
    compatible with QGIS 2.18
    0.1 - Initial version
